# A New Box for the Acorn Atom

You have an Acorn Atom, it's one of your most prized things. You still have the styrofoam container, but the cardboard either disappeared or died many years ago. If only there were an alternative?

Well there is!

This repo contains the files you will need to have your own custom box for the Acorn Atom printed and cut for you! 

Chris Curry is even there to greet you when you open the box.

## Background

Many years ago, I owned an Atom. It was purchased from someone who had assembled it from a kit, so I never had a box. But that was fine, since I left the machine behind when I moved to the US. Well, not fine, but you know what I mean. 

Upon finding another machine second hand on EBay, I realized I needed something better for storage. I found a few old advertisements on the internet, and - regenerating the artwork from scratch - used these as a baseline to re-imagine how the box could look.

I hope that your Atom likes its new home as much as me!

## Getting Your Box Made

This design is based on the layout provided by [Box Genie](https://www.boxgenie.com). They had pretty fast turn around and would fix mistakes they had made and re-print on their dime. The only thing was that they weren't so hot on getting the colors right first time. Try another vendor, or be persistent.

## 3D Printed Insert

The box is actually oversized deliberately. I found that I had a few essentials that would just not fit in the original styrofoam case. This project includes an adjustible 3D printed design that will fill the void, allowing you to add a few of those extras.

You will need to print two of the "half" STLs, as well as likely a couple of the movable inserts. The halves should clip together, but you may decide to glue them for additional security.
